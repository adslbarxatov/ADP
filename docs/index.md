# Introduction

***Objects*** of this Policy (hereinafter referred to as ***Policy Objects***) are products (including software), materials and developments of the Laboratory.

***Scope*** of this Policy (hereinafter referred to as ***Policy Scope***) are all communities, channels and hostings managed by the Laboratory,
the Laboratory itself, as well as Policy Objects.

This Policy (ADP), its positions, conclusion, end-user license agreement and application order are describing general rules
that Laboratory follows when developing, maintaining and using Policy Objects.

***The Policy is required to be acquainted with by all participants of the Policy Scope and users before using any of the Policy Objects.
By downloading them, you fully agree with this Policy and accept it!***

&nbsp;



# Clauses of the Policy

Points `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5` and `8` (marked with a :warning: sign) are ***mandatory***.

Points `6` and `7` (marked with a :heavy_check_mark: sign) are ***advisory***.

&nbsp;



### 1. We work on free base

:warning: There are no explicit or implied payments for Policy Objects. If some Objects use components
with partially free licenses, this is reflected in the annotations of the respective projects.

### 2. We don’t use ads

:warning: The Policy Objects have no promotional elements, except for links to the Laboratory’s own projects.
All links can only be called by the user and only manually and have no automatic triggers.

### 3. We don’t use autoupdate

:warning: None of Policy Objects will update its functionality without the direct participation of the user.
Non-executable content may be updated automatically if the correct functioning of the Object becomes impossible without it.

### 4. We don’t use hidden functionality

:warning: Policy objects have no code with undeclared purposes (uncontrolled updates, data collection, downloading
of third-party content). All features of Objects are described in user manuals and / or project summaries.

### 5. We don’t collect personal data

:warning: Policy Objects have no algorithms for collecting / accumulating / transferring of personal information.
All data used by Objects doesn’t leave user’s devices.

### 6. Our products are open-source

:heavy_check_mark: All code and source material, which has no special restrictions, is open to all uses, except
for the depersonalization of the ideas and solutions presented in it (that is, the removal of the license and signatures).

### 7. We welcome recommendations and bug reports

:heavy_check_mark: Your comments, messages, advice and wishes allow the Laboratory to improve the solutions created
and are the only way to improve them.

### 8. We don’t leave our users

:warning: All Policy Objects have developer support. All users can ask for help when using Objects.

&nbsp;



# Conclusion

Clauses of the Policy derive one from another and guarantee that:
- The Lab does not include payments, advertising, hidden and / or unannounced features, uncontrolled updates,
de-anonymization features, and other items in Policy Objects that are inconsistent with this Policy.
- The Lab welcomes cooperation with users offering assistance or requiring assistance in the development /
maintenance of the main and / or subsidiary projects of the Laboratory.

&nbsp;



# XPUN control

Since 2020, some countries have introduced new restrictive laws (`[description is classified]`) that are incompatible with this Policy.
The laboratory sees it as its task to avoid any conflicts associated with this discrepancy.
The only way to do this, available at the time of publication of this Policy revision, is to make all Policy Objects unavailable in those countries.

In this regard, FDF, the Lab co-founder implemented the **XPUN control mechanism** (`[description is classified]`).
This algorithm is present in all actual Policy Objects. For now, it restricts the launch of corresponding apps
in the following countries:
- Belgium
- Canada
- Denmark
- Estonia
- Ireland
- Latvia
- Lithuania
- Luxembourg
- Netherlands
- United Kingdom

&nbsp;



# End user license agreement

Policy Objects and any updates are being delivered “as is”. ***Laboratory*** may try to, but
***does not and cannot warrant*** the performance, results, absence of crushes and / or data
losses you may obtain by using them. ***All Policy Objects are used at your own risk***, without
any guarantees and compensations, explicit and implied (except described above). The Policy
doesn’t provide for any liability on the part of the Laboratory.

&nbsp;



# Application order

1. In the event that any Policy Object conflicts (even if fully compliant with it) with
   the [FDL’s Social community policy (SCP)](https://adslbarxatov.github.io/SCP),
   SCP will take precedence in handling the conflict.
2. Acquaintance with a Policy is mandatory. Failure to become acquainted with the Policy doesn’t deprive the Laboratory administration of the right to apply it.
3. Agreement with the Policy is not required for participation in the Policy Scope.
4. Disagreement with the Policy is not the basis for any sanctions against a member of the Policy Scope.
5. Publication of Policy Objects that aren’t consistent with the Policy in materials /
comments / news feeds of the Policy Scope may be limited or terminated at decision of the administration.
