# Introduction

This Policy (ADP), its positions, conclusion, end-user license agreement and application order are describing general rules
that Laboratory follows in all development processes, released projects and implemented ideas.

***It must be acquainted by participants and users before using any of Laboratory’s products. By downloading them,
you completely agree to this Policy and accept it!***

&nbsp;



# Clauses of the Policy

Points `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5` and `8` (marked with a :warning: sign) are ***mandatory***.

Points `6` and `7` (marked with a :heavy_check_mark: sign) are ***advisory***.

### 1. We work on free base

:warning: No apparent or hidden payments are provided for Lab developments. If some products are using libraries
with partially-free licenses, it is declared in annotations of corresponding projects.

### 2. We don’t use ads

:warning: Lab developments have no advertisement elements except of links to other own projects.
All links can only be called by user and have no automatic triggers.

### 3. We don’t use autoupdate

:warning: None of Lab products will update their functionality without direct involvement of user.
Non-executable content may be updated automatically if an absence of it makes impossible the correct
functioning of the product.

### 4. We don’t use hidden functionality

:warning: Lab products have no code with undeclared aims (uncontrollable updating, data collecting, downloading
of extraneous content). All functions of products are described in user manuals and / or their annotations.

### 5. We don’t collect personal data

:warning: Lab applications have no algorithms for gathering / accumulating / sending of private info. All data used
by utilities doesn’t leave user’s device.

### 6. Our products are open-source

:heavy_check_mark: All code that has no special limitations is open for all use cases except removing license text
and, as a result, depersonalization of ideas presented in it.

### 7. We welcome recommendations and bug reports

:heavy_check_mark: Your comments, reports, advices and wishes allow Laboratory to improve created products. It is the only way
to know what Laboratory needs to be better.

### 8. We don’t leave our users

:warning: All products of Laboratory have developers support. All users can ask for help when using Lab projects.

# Conclusion

Clauses of the Policy derive one from another and guarantee that:
- The Lab will not include payments, ads, hidden and / or unexpected functionality, uncontrollable updates, de-anonymizing
algorithms and other elements that aren’t compatible with this Policy.
- The Lab welcomes cooperation with users offering assistance or requiring assistance in the development / maintenance
processes of the main and / or child Lab products.

&nbsp;



# XPUN control

Since 2020, some countries have introduced new restrictive laws (`[description is classified]`) that are incompatible with this Policy.
Laboratory wants to avoid any conflicts related to this discrepancy. The only way to do this is to make all products unavailable in those countries.

In this regard, FDF, the Lab co-founder implemented the **XPUN control mechanism** (`[description is classified]`).
This algorithm is present in all actual products of the Laboratory. For now, it restricts the launch of corresponding apps
in the following countries:
- Belgium
- Denmark
- Ireland
- Latvia
- Lithuania
- Luxembourg
- Netherlands
- Poland
- United Kingdom
- Czech
- Estonia

Unfortunately, there is no other legal way around this situation yet. The laboratory hopes for your understanding.

&nbsp;



# End user license agreement

Our products and any updates are being delivered “as is”. ***Laboratory*** may try to, but
***does not and cannot warrant*** the performance, results, absence of crushes and / or data
losses you may obtain by using them. ***All products are used at your own risk***, without
any guarantees and compensations, explicit and implied (except described above). There is
no liability on the part of Laboratory.

&nbsp;



# Application order
