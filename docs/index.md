# Introduction

***Objects*** of this Policy (hereinafter referred to as ***Policy Objects***) are products (including software), materials and developments of the Laboratory.

***Scope*** of this Policy (hereinafter referred to as ***Policy Scope***) are all communities, channels and hostings managed by the Laboratory,
the Laboratory itself, as well as all Policy Objects.

This Policy (ADP), its positions, conclusion, the end-user license agreement and application order are describing general rules
that Laboratory follows when developing, maintaining and using Policy Objects.

***The Policy is required to be acquainted with by all participants of the Policy Scope and users before using any of the Policy Objects.
By starting to work with them, you fully agree with this Policy and accept it!***

&nbsp;



# Clauses of the Policy

### 1. We work on free base

There are no explicit or implied payments for Policy Objects. It is reflected in the annotations
of the corresponding projects if Objects use components with partially free licenses.

### 2. We don’t use ads

The Policy Objects have no promotional elements, except for references to the Laboratory’s own projects.
All references can only be activated by the user and only manually (they have no automatic triggers).

### 3. We don’t use autoupdate

None of Policy Objects can update its functionality without the direct participation of the user.
Non-executable content may be updated automatically if the correct functioning of the Object becomes impossible without it.

### 4. We don’t use hidden functionality

Policy Objects have no code with undeclared purposes (uncontrolled updates, data collection, downloading
of third-party content). All features of Objects are described in user guides and / or project summaries.

### 5. We don’t collect personal data

Policy Objects have no algorithms for collecting, accumulating or transferring of personal information.
All data used by Policy Objects doesn’t leave the user device.

### 6. Our products are open-source

All code and source material, which has no special restrictions, is open to all uses, except
for the depersonalization of the ideas and solutions presented in it. Therefore, all copies
should include the reference to at least one of Laboratory’s communities.

### 7. We welcome recommendations and bug reports

Comments, messages, advice and wishes of users allow the Laboratory to improve the solutions created
and are the main way to improve them. Therefore, all Policy Objects provide communication channels with the Laboratory.

### 8. We don’t leave our users

All Policy Objects have developer support. All users can ask for help and support when using Policy Objects.

&nbsp;



# Conclusion

Clauses of the Policy derive one from another and guarantee that:
- The Lab does not include payments, advertising, hidden and / or unannounced features, uncontrolled updates,
de-anonymization features, and other items in Policy Objects that are inconsistent with this Policy.
- The Lab welcomes cooperation with users offering assistance or requiring assistance in the development and / or
maintenance of the main and / or subsidiary projects of the Laboratory.

&nbsp;



# XPUN control

Since 2020, some governments have introduced certain restrictive laws of disintegration nature in their territories
that are incompatible with this Policy. The Laboratory sees it as its task to avoid any conflicts associated with
this discrepancy. The only way to do this, available at the time of publication of this Policy revision, is to make
all Policy Objects unavailable in those areas.

In this regard, **XPUN control** was developed. The current version of the Policy defines that:
- This algorithm is present in all actual Policy Objects.
- Its only function is to restrict the launch of Policy Objects in the following territories:
    - Belgium
    - Canada
    - Czech Republic
    - Denmark
    - Estonia
    - Germany
    - Ireland
    - Japan
    - Latvia
    - Lithuania
    - Luxembourg
    - Netherlands
    - Norway
    - Switzerland
    - United Kingdom

&nbsp;



# End user license agreement

Policy Objects and any updates are being delivered “as is”. ***Laboratory*** may try to, but
***does not and cannot warrant*** the performance, results, absence of crushes and / or data
losses you may obtain by using them. ***All Policy Objects are used at your own risk***, without
any guarantees and compensations, explicit and implied (except described above). The Policy
doesn’t provide for any liability on the part of the Laboratory.

&nbsp;



# Application order

1. In the event that any Policy Object conflicts (even if fully compliant with it) with
   the [FDL’s Social community policy (SCP)](https://adslbarxatov.github.io/SCP),
   SCP will take precedence in handling the conflict.
2. Acquaintance with a Policy is mandatory. Failure to become acquainted with the Policy doesn’t
   deprive the Laboratory administration of the right to apply it.
3. Agreement with the Policy is not required for participation in the Policy Scope.
4. Disagreement with the Policy is not the basis for any sanctions against a member of the Policy Scope.
5. Publication of Policy Objects those aren’t consistent with the Policy in materials,
   comments and / or news feeds of the Policy Scope may be limited or terminated at decision of the administration.
